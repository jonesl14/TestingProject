[IMPORTANT!!]
I discovered a bug which causes the menus to stop responding to any input. This bug is triggered by using the mouse to select(click) a menu option. To avoid this you should instead use WASD/arrow keys for navigation and the 'enter' key to select an option.

You can now press the escape key to bypass the bug that previously prevented you from testing my project.
